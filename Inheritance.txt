1)A derived class does not inherit the base class' special functions: constructors, destructors or assignment operators. 

2)class Derived : access Base {

    // ...

};

 The default access is private.

3)Public Inheritance − When deriving a class from a public base class, public members of the base class become public members of the derived class and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. A base class's private members are never accessible directly from a derived class, but can be accessed through calls to the public and protected members of the base class.

Protected Inheritance − When deriving from a protected base class, public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.

Private Inheritance − When deriving from a private base class, public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class.
