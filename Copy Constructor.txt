the key difference lies in when they are called and their intended use cases:

->The copy constructor is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing 
object when the new object is being initialized.

->The copy assignment operator is used to modify an existing object to match the 
contents of another existing object. It's called explicitly when assigning one 
object to another. It should also check for self-assignment to avoid issues.
