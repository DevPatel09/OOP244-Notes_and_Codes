7.	The constructor’s name is same as the class name.	
        Here, its name is also same as the class name preceded by the tiled (~) operator.
8.	In a class, there can be multiple constructors.	
        While in a class, there is always a single destructor.
9.	There is a concept of copy constructor which is used to initialize an object from another object.	
        While here, there is no copy destructor concept.
10.	They are often called in successive order.	
        They are often called in reverse order of constructor
